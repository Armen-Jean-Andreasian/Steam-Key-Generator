## Description

The Steam Key Generator is a Python program that allows you to generate Steam-like keys with different formats based on the specified generation type. It creates keys in a format similar to those used on the Steam platform.

The generated keys can be used for various purposes, such as testing or creating a fun and engaging user experience.
